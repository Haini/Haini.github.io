<p>[Opinion Based]</p>
<p>
I got pointed to the work of Erich Fromm by a friend recently. Reading up on the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haben_oder_Sein">Wikipedia Article</a> related to his book revealed a conclusion that very much resembles my own ideals. So I thought I would share those thoughts and add my own as deemed necessary.
</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>Production has to serve the purpose of fulfilling the real needs of humanity,
not the needs of the economy.</code></pre>
<p>
<p>I agree that economy should not be an end in itself, e.g. producing goods that are not needed by anyone. These goods still get consumed, as they are there and why wouldn’t you buy something that you don’t have.</p>
<p>But this approach to production is also the biggest driver for innovation. The incentive to invent something that no one in the world has <em>yet</em> is one that can’t be denied.</p>
This leads me to following question: <em>Who</em> defines what is necessary for humanity, and (maybe even more significant) <em>what</em> is deemed as necessary?
</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>The current relationship of exploiting nature is replaced by a cooperation 
between nature and humanity. </code></pre>
<p>
A world where humans and nature can live in peace? I can’t see why humanity is not part of nature in the first point. We were created in it, molded by it. What I can see is a more responsible approach to using our resources - exploiting resources is part of our nature, the way we exploit them can be controlled.
</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>Antagonism between humans is replaced by solidarity. </code></pre>
<p>
<p>This is a very current topic. It poses a dilemma that may be solved in a perfect world. Solidarity works in small local groups that are mostly homogeneous, but as soon as one tries to apply it to a more global level some limits are shown.</p>
These limits could be overcome by one of the following points.
</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>Society needs to make arrangements that put the well-being of humanity and the
prevention of human suffering first. </code></pre>
<p>
No questions asked here, every human has the right to live free from suffering.
</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>Maximum consume has to replaced by responsible consume.</code></pre>
<p>
<p>This should have been one of the first bullet points as it shows the basic concept that is needed to make all the other points work properly.</p>
<p>Consuming just as much as you need to live a prosperous live - where prosperous means that you don’t need to worry about physiological or safety concerns - is the key to a fair world.</p>
<p>And it also poses the most important question: How much of my wealth am I willing to loose. Because - as of now - I own and consume way more than I every should. So I would be on the losers side, period.</p>
So, it really boils down to <em>having</em> or <em>being</em>. If I <em>exist</em> without the purpose of accumulating goods I can’t loose any of them.
</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>The single individual is motivated to actively contribute to the life of society.</code></pre>
<p>
I can’t say what kind contributions are meant, they could be in a materialistic way - e.g. providing workforce to produce the minimum of goods that are needed to sustain above goals or to spend time in cultural habits, exchanging thoughts and knowledge.
</p>
<h1>
Conclusion
</h1>
<p>I like the way Fromm describes a future, ascended world, and while he purely focused on <em>being</em>, my annotations tend to drift into the world of <em>having</em>.</p>
<p>There are reasons for this, as I share his basic idea, but can’t put away the strive for <em>having</em> as I see it as a major driver of any advancements humanity made. What I share is that humanity can work on a greater goal together, stepping back on own needs for a more fair and productive world.</p>
<p>Working together and yielding the total potential of 7 billion brains is only achievable if every individual steps back on its needs and its wealth. This does not necessarily mean that you have to devote your life to endless hours of work, but that you will provide value to the society in a way that matches your interests and skill set.</p>
<p>It also means that one has to step back on <em>having</em>, but not to an extent like Fromm describes, keeping it as a basic motivation and intrinsic factor of humanity.</p>
