<h2>
Promising start…
</h2>
<p>
I am that kind of person that likes to track every aspect of their live, even if that implies to provide all my data to companies like Microsoft, Google and the likes. Since I have no problem with that I got a Microsoft Band 2 last year. It was meant as an upgrade to my Garmin Vivofit and fulfilled this role to its fullest. The Band 2 did look good, feel good, had tons of sensors (not even MS did bother to query and display them all) and was overall a good working eco system. Data was tracked accurately, the app did work well, the website too.
</p>
<h2>
With a first down…
</h2>
<p>
So after using the band for all sorts of activities (running, cycling, Volleyball, Workouts, …) for 6 months the first signs of tear on the wrist band showed up. I didn’t panic, said myself that was the luck of the early adapter and requested a spare from Microsoft’s customer support. They were more than happy to help me, providing me with a spare, free shipping and all was good. They did, however, not update the serial number of the device. I didn’t bother much because, it ain’t gonna tear again, right?
</p>
<h2>
The journey continues…
</h2>
<p>
<em>Right?</em>. I continued to use the band with a little bit more considerations, i.e. I did drop Volleyball from the list of tracked activities as I suspected it to be the main reason for any tear. Updates for the app and website came, and I was very satisfied with the tracking accuracy of heart rate, gps and UV exposure! After a holiday in Italy without internet I noticed that the band would not sync with the app if there is no working internet connection, which is quite a show stopper. But the holiday went by and so did my anger.
</p>
<h2>
Loosing it all…
</h2>
<p>
<em>Right?</em> Quite exactly after 6 months of usage something that resembled a gap at the very same spot the first Band did show one turned up. As I was already experienced I contacted Microsoft’s Customer support that told me I was sadly out of warranty. Because they didn’t change the serial number the first time, damn. Luckily I live in Europe, where re sellers are forced to provide 2 years of guarantee on nearly anything - so I took it to Amazon. The support there was also really helpful. I had the feeling that they have quite a process in place for all those poor Microsoft Band 2 customers already. Since no Band 2s are produced anymore and Amazon is paying a huge amount of money for shipping anyways they instantly (without any discussion on whether it was my fault or not) offered my a total refund. As I didn’t want to switch my device <em>again</em> in 6 months I gratefully accepted their offer.
</p>
<h2>
A big loss
</h2>
<p>
As I started to look for alternatives I noticed that not one product matches the Microsoft Band 2 in terms of style, sensors, functionality and price for value. Well, the Fitbit Surge is quite old already, and the Garmin Vivofit HR isn’t the newest one also. Both provide a just fine eco system but really lack a competitive design. The Apple Watch sucks at price for value and providing good battery live while on GPS.
</p>
<p>
<p>Given the performance of the competitors on the market it is a shame that Microsoft did pull out of the fitness tracker business. Some improvements on the hardware and the upcoming features of the Band 3 would have once again pushed them to the top of my “Would purchase ASAP” list.</p>
